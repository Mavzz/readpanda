Who is the user?
The user is someone who enjoys reading and wants to be part of a book club with their friends, but is unable to figure out a set time due to scheduling, location and reading pace conflicts. They want the enjoyment of reading a book together, and commenting on their favourite parts but only with their closest friends, not publicly. 
What problem are we solving?
The problem being solved is one of creating an app where one can create “rooms” to read a book with a select group of friends. Currently, reading apps, when you annotate, highlight, or comment on a book, showcase that publicly. In this, whatever you comment will be visible only privately to a select group of people. 

This can be used to have virtual, long distance book clubs, reconnect with people over love of books. 

There can also be public rooms that one can create, so they can connect with people over a book they like. Instead of having to go through book groups to find people who have interest in the book, the book is the central part around which people connect. Each room can be set to a limit, ranging till 20 people, to keep the rooms as close knit as possible, instead of becoming too huge to control. 
Why does it matter?
It is a way to help people come together around books again, a virtual yet private platform. Currently every platform that can be used for this purpose is only public, or tertiary platforms like discord, instagram or reddit. This combines both the purposes of a book sharing platform and a group platform. 
2. Define the User Persona (Who?)

A frequent reader who loves books and wants to share their thoughts throughout the book with their friends. But using tertiary apps makes it harder, as either the friend hasn’t reached that specific part of the book and is met with spoilers, or is unable to recall exactly what they are talking about.

Read Panda will allow there be to conversation and comments at specific parts of the book, being a convergence between social media and book reading platforms. 
3. Capture the Goal or Action (What?)
I want to be able to read a book with my friends.
There will be bookmarks to mark till where each person has read. 
When I comment on a specific part of a book I want only the people in my reading room to see them, not publicly. 
4. Define the Value/Benefit (Why?)
The main point of reading clubs and books has been to bring together a group of people who read the same book and discuss it, sharing in the joy of it. Reading groups/book groups nowadays are slewed, especially nowadays, where the central idea of reading the same book has changed into recommendations, and maybe a few comments on a similarly read book. 

Read Panda aims to bring the focus back onto books, creating small private spaces for select people, where groups are formed around the book. Capping the amount of people in a room allows there to be wholesome communication about the book.
